#  Towards Trusted DCR Choreographies
This code implements the proof-of-concept presented in the paper <em>Towards Trusted DCR Choreographies</em> submitted for the Coopis'20 conference. 
This portal projects an input global DCR choreography over each tenant view. 
- The shared public tasks are gathered together in a public DCR graph. The later is compiled and updated in the blokchain for trust purposes. 
- The tenant projections are updated locally for privacy concerns. Each one of the incorporated public tasks communicates with the blockchain-based DCR graph. 


## Input DCR
The global DCR textual description can be found under inputExample.tex
